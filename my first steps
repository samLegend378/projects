✅ AWS Security Task 01 – Enabling MFA and Creating IAM User

As part of my Cloud Security learning journey, I completed the following foundational AWS security steps:
🔐 Task Summary:

    Enabled Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on the AWS root user account

    Created a new IAM user with administrator privileges

    Stored root credentials securely and will only use the root user when absolutely necessary

🧠 Why This Matters:

    MFA helps protect against unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised

    IAM users allow for principle of least privilege and safer management of AWS resources

    This is the first step in following AWS security best practices before building and deploying anything in the cloud

🌱 Next Step:

I'll continue securing my AWS environment and begin practical cloud security projects, including:

    IAM policy design

    S3 bucket security

    GuardDuty configuration

    VPC network segmentation
