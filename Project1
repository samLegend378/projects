# AWS Static Website Hosting with S3

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates hosting a static website using **Amazon S3** under the AWS Free Tier.  
It was my first hands-on AWS project after earning my **AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02)** certification.  

## 🛠️ Steps Performed
1. Created an S3 bucket with public access for website hosting.
2. Uploaded an `index.html` file.
3. Configured bucket permissions and bucket policy for public read access.
4. Enabled static website hosting and obtained the **S3 website endpoint**.
